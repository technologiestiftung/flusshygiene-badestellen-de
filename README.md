Small toolset to parse a `.csv` with lots of data into `.json` and `.jsonl` for better handling.

The following transformations take place (folder `parsing`):

- Convert CSV encoding from CP850 to UTF8
- Convert CSV to JSON
- Group content by Spot ID (BWID)
- Write to JSON
- Create JSONL (each line is a valid json object)
- Write JSONL

```bash
cd parsing
npm install 
npm run build
node dist/cli.js ./data/badegewaesser.csv -jsonl=true
```

Use the script in folder `inspect` to read the file line by line (currently only the first line is printed to console).

```bash
cd inspect
npm install 
npm run build
node dist/cli.js ../parsing/data/badegewaesser.csv
```
